Dumb, worship dragons. Stole a wagon from [[Characters/Lord Warden Aurelio Markelhay\|Lord Warden]].
Reside in the abandoned mannor in the [[Places/Cloakwood\|Cloakwood]]. Masters of traps.
They have explosive alchemists, flying fake-dragons and stabby little spears.
They are performing some kind of ritual using red dragons hide.
They hate if you insult their fake-wings and mock the fact that they are not dragons.

Did some kind of ritual that partially transformed one of them into a dragon partially. 
He died shortly after the ritual. Probably taught the ritual by [[Characters/Creepy Stoned Knight Imp Killer - Lucian... something\|a creep]].
