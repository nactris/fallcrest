Killed an imp with one swing. Popped into existence. Waaaaay too interested in [[PCs/Yonder\|Yonder]].
Tough bastard, died in the end, brought everyone close to death at least once. Terribly slow heartbeat, pale skin, hollow soul and dead inside. You know the type. Does not fear death. He welcomed it with silence.
