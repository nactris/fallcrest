Scruffy looking elven kid, around 21. Cheeky, smug and overly self confident. 
Captivated by everthing glittery
Friends with [[PCs/Zimrial\|Zimzim]].
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat.

Can speak dwarven at around B1.
Mira is 5'11".

LOVES sweets. Sour things are tasty too.
# Relationships
[[PCs/Gingersnap\|Granny]] is nice (scary when angry tho). Mira visits from time to time but does not want to impose herself on her or inconvenience her or Yonder. 
[[PCs/Zimrial\|Zims]] is a frien. She sings nice and keeps folks at pub distracted!
[[PCs/Yonder\|Yonder]] is kinda scary but funny at the same time. DO NOT GET ON HIS BAD SIDE!
[[PCs/Nino\|Nino]]... Mira is not sure what to make of him...
