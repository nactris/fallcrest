Scruffy looking elven kid, around 21. Cheeky, smug and overly self-confident. 
Captivated by everything glittery.
Friends with [[PCs/Zimrial\|Zimzim]].
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat.
Can speak dwarven at around B1.
Mira is 5'11".
At some point she fell out of reality.
LOVES sweets. Sour and salty things are tasty too, but sweet is the way to go.
# Relationships
[[PCs/Gingersnap\|Granny]] is nice (scary when angry tho). Mira visits from time to time but does not want to impose herself on her or inconvenience her or Yonder. 
[[PCs/Zimrial\|Zims]] is a frien. She sings nice and keeps folks at pub distracted!
[[PCs/Yonder\|Yonder]] is kinda scary but funny at the same time. DO NOT GET ON HIS BAD SIDE!
[[PCs/Nino\|Nino]]... Mira is not sure what to make of him...
