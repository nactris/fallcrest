Scruffy looking elven kid, around 21. Cheeky, smug and overly self-confident. 
Captivated by everything glittery.
Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat.
Mira is 5'11".
# Trivia
At some point she fell out of reality.
LOVES sweets. Sour and salty things are tasty too, but sweet is the way to go.
Can speak dwarven at around B1.
Mira uses a pair of daggers made from [[PCs/Additional Info/Mira's Fighting Style\|repurposed scissors]]. The daggers can be put together to serve as scissors.
Somehow she "attracts" bone pieces from Nino, kinda in a supernatural way - every fight some pieces are in her hair and clothes. Also those are additional copies from time to time.
As she looks closely, her ears perk up (kinda like bunny, cute)
# Relationships
[[PCs/Gingersnap Myra\|Granny]] is nice (scary when angry tho). Mira visits from time to time but does not want to impose herself on her or inconvenience her or Yonder. 
[[PCs/Zimrial\|Zims]] is a frien. She sings nice and keeps folks at pub distracted!
[[PCs/Yonder\|Yonder]] is kinda scary but funny at the same time. DO NOT GET ON HIS BAD SIDE!
[[PCs/Nino Markelhay\|Nino]]... Mira is not sure what to make of him... Mira is curious about him but also kinda creeped out. More curious tho, getting used to him as she finds more pieces of him in her hair.
