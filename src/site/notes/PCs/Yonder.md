#PC
Lives with [[PCs/Gingersnap Myra\|Gingersnap]] on a [[Places/Yondersnap Homestead\|farm]], it was originally Yonder's.
Likes animal and also rats (probably).
Can speak to animals.
Likes giving scritches to animals!

Mossy looking robot with plant growth over them.
They have a animal fur coat. (some predator) does not really get cold but wears the coat to appease [[PCs/Gingersnap Myra\|Ginger]]. Yonder is very big and bulky. They have horns and claws. Serious looking face. Kind of looks like a beetle.

(MY DUDE HESS RUDEEE XDDDDD, HE DID MIDDLE FINGER TO [[Characters/Sergant Murgeddin\|Sergant Murgeddin]])
Yonder can transform into a bear, or different animals depending on mood and situation.

They have a dwarven overwritten marks seared into his insides - those are visible only when yonder transforms. (Those are old. )
