#PC
Lives with [[PCs/Gingersnap\|Gingersnap]] on a [[Places/Yondersnap Homestead\|farm]], it was originally Yonder's.
Likes animal and also rats (probably).

Mossy looking robot with plant growth over them.
They have a animal fur coat. (some predator) does not really get cold but wears the coat to appease [[PCs/Gingersnap\|Gingersnap]]. Yonder is very big and bulky. They have horns and claws. Serious looking face. Kind of looks like a beetle.

(MY DUDE HESS RUDEEE XDDDDD)
Yonder can transform into a bear, or different animals depending on mood and situation.

They have a dwarven overwritten marks seared into his insides - those are visible only when yonder transforms. (Those are old. )

*"My story is not interesting"* - says the robot druid shapeshifting into animals.
