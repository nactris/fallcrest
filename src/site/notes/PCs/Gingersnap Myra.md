#PC
4 feet tall old dwarven lady. Has a undead friend [[PCs/Nino Markelhay\|Nino]]. 
Gets cold easily wears warm clothes, has very long hair, organized uniform, comfortable and braided. Constantly smells like ginger.
Lives together with [[PCs/Yonder\|Yonder]] on a [[Places/Yondersnap Homestead\|farm]].
Talks to dead people. ☠
Knows [[PCs/Mira\|Mira]].

As she casts spells she gets "older" and weaker. Looks like she is draining herself.

Her power is definitely NOT connected to Diabolist.
Her healing feels like warm wind in autumn and the smell of spices.

She can apparently summon a horde of undead. Kind of terrifying to look at. 
They are very nice though! Dancers, servants normal people, one was kind enough to heal Zimmy.
# Relationships
Cares a lot about [[PCs/Nino Markelhay\|Nino Markelhay]], treats him kinda like son. (He is dead thou)
So far treats [[PCs/Mira\|Mira]] like a baby, instinctively takes care of her, wipes her mouth and such.
*not much more is known*
