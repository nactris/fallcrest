Mira fights using repurposed pair of scissors picked apart to serve as daggers. Mira had some text in Elvish etched onto the surface of the blades.

# Cool Battle Moves
### Base

> [!NOTE] Rush Attack
> Once on each of your turns, your rogue melee weapon attack
> deals an additional +1d6 damage against an enemy you were not
> engaged with at the start of your turn if you hit. Decide whether
> you are using Rush Attack before rolling an eligible attack.

> [!NOTE] Bravado
> There’s no limit to how many points of Bravado you can have,
> but your Bravado resets to 0 when you take a quick rest or a full
> heal-up.
> There are two standard ways to gain a point of Bravado.
> 
> **Initiative:** You gain a point of Bravado when your natural
> initiative roll is even.
> 
> **Hitting:** You also gain a point of Bravado the first time you
> hit with a rogue attack on each of your turns. (In other words,
> hitting with an opportunity attack won’t give you a point of
> Bravado.)

| 2nd  | +5 (2d4) damage   |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| 3rd  | +7 (2d6) damage   |
| 4th  | +9 (2d8) damage   |
| 5th  | +11 (2d10) damage |
| 6th  | +14 (4d6) damage  |
| 7th  | +18 (4d8) damage  |
| 8th  | +22 damage        |
| 9th  | +30 damage        |
| 10th | +40 damage        |
| 11th |  +50 damage       |
| 12th | +60 damage        |

### Talents 

> [!NOTE] Subdimensional Dive
> *You gain the subdimensional dive at-will power*
> As a quick action before you have used a standard action
> this turn, you can make the following shadow walk attack
> against the enemy with the highest Mental Defense.
> ---
> **Subdimensional Dive**
> **Close-quarters attack** ◆ **At-Will if used while not engaged;**
> **expended until end of battle if used while engaged** ◆
> Quick action
> **Target:** Nearby enemy with the highest MD
> **Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD
> 
> **Special:** Hitting with shadow walk does not give you a point of
> Bravado.
> **Special:** Instead of rolling this attack, you can spend a point of
> Bravado to turn it into an automatic hit.
> 
> **Hit:** Remove yourself from play and take no further actions this
> turn or until the start of your next turn. At the start of your
> next turn, return anywhere nearby that you could have moved
> to normally during your turn, and deal double damage with
> your first attack roll that turn. (As usual, add your relevant
> Sneak Attack or Rush Attack damage first before doubling.)
> (And no monkeying around with delaying and such here:
> return on your initiative and take your turn.)
> 
> **Miss:** No effect. You can’t attempt to shadow walk again until
> your next turn, but you still have your standard action this
> turn, and possibly your move action.




> [!NOTE] Like Salt to the Wounds.
> Your crit range against staggered enemies expands by 2




> [!NOTE] Glitchy Movements
> You gain a +3 bonus to disengage checks. In addition, while you
> are moving, if an enemy moves to intercept you, you can make a
> disengage check as a free action to avoid that enemy. (Since you
> may not have seen the intercept rules on page 296 yet, we’ll
> mention that only one enemy can try to intercept you each turn.
> You are uniquely likely to get past the interceptor and reach
> your real target; and don’t forget that magic boots will help your
> disengage checks.)


### Powers (1st level)

> [!NOTE] Non-Euclidean Stab
> *Same as basic ranged attack except:*
> **Special**: You must use a small, bladed weapon or a hand
> crossbow with this attack. (For you, those are both d6
> weapons when used for a ranged attack.) If you spend a point
> of Bravado before rolling your attack, you can add your Rush
> Attack or Sneak Attack damage to the hit, even if the target
> would not normally be eligible for that damage.
> Target: One nearby enemy



> [!NOTE] Dance of Fractals 
> Melee attack ◆ **At-Will, but costs 1 Bravado**
> **Special:** Hitting with this attack doesn’t give you Bravado
> **First Target:** One engaged enemy
> **First Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD
> **Hit:** Psychic damage equal to your level, but no other
> damage of any type, and you can make an improved
> melee attack against the same target or a different
> engaged target.
> **Natural even hit or miss:** The target is also dazed until the
> end of your next turn.
> **Miss**: Your attack action is over; the feint was a screw-up.
> Second Target: The same enemy as the first attack or a
> different engaged enemy.
> **Second Attack:** Dexterity + Level +4 vs. AC
> **Hit**: Weapon + Dexterity damage, and improve damage
> at 5th level and above exactly like your basic attack
> progression.
> **Miss**: Half damage.



> [!NOTE] ??? (don't remember name)
> *Same as rogue basic melee attack except . . .*
> **Hit:** Same basic attack damage, and you can pop free from the
target.


### Feats

> [!NOTE] Rogue of Two-Weapons (Adventurer-tier)
You can now wield two melee weapons and get the two-weapon
fighting advantage described on page 314: hitting with your
melee attacks on a natural 2.
