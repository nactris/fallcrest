Mira fights using repurposed pair of scissors picked apart to serve as daggers. Mira had some text in Elvish etched onto the surface of the blades.

# Cool Battle Moves

> [!NOTE] Non-Euclidean Stab
> *Same as basic ranged attack except:*
> **Special**: You must use a small, bladed weapon or a hand
> crossbow with this attack. (For you, those are both d6
> weapons when used for a ranged attack.) If you spend a point
> of Bravado before rolling your attack, you can add your Rush
> Attack or Sneak Attack damage to the hit, even if the target
> would not normally be eligible for that damage.
> Target: One nearby enemy



> [!NOTE] Dance of Fractals
> Melee attack ◆ **At-Will, but costs 1 Bravado**
> **Special:** Hitting with this attack doesn’t give you Bravado
> **First Target:** One engaged enemy
> **First Attack:** Charisma + Level vs. MD
> **Hit:** Psychic damage equal to your level, but no other
> damage of any type, and you can make an improved
> melee attack against the same target or a different
> engaged target.
> **Natural even hit or miss:** The target is also dazed until the
> end of your next turn.
> **Miss**: Your attack action is over; the feint was a screw-up.
> Second Target: The same enemy as the first attack or a
> different engaged enemy.
> **Second Attack:** Dexterity + Level +4 vs. AC
> **Hit**: Weapon + Dexterity damage, and improve damage
> at 5th level and above exactly like your basic attack
> progression.
> **Miss**: Half damage.
