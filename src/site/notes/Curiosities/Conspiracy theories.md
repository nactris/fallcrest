[[PCs/Yonder\|Yonder]] has some symbols on his inside tied to Diabolist from time where he was jailbroken. [[PCs/Zimrial\|Zimrial]] has a ring with similar symbols. Something about being freed from dwarven control?
Symbols saved his life, clear connection to diabolist.

[[PCs/Gingersnap Myra\|Ginger]] wakes up dead with compassion, as opposed to lich using dominance. Source of power? Lich is probably not very content someone is stepping on his trademark.
